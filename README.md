## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to expand upon Roza's work and to study the bacterial colonies in people and determine the 10 most common types. The data is kept in the "samples.json" file and has the ids for the patients, some informations about them, the frequency of scrubbing, and what was found.


## Background 

This type of work can be useful because types of bacteria can be used in the food industry as well as many others, such as in the process of trying to synthesize products. Naval bacteria can also lead researchers to a lot of information about their host, as to their health, immune system, and other bodily functions. The information can be found by interacting with a drop down menu to allow the user to select the ID of the person they wish to examine.
